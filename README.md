# Problem Statement
Identification of different Cancer diseases is to determinefirst the type of scan (breast or brain in our case)and then determining whether the scan is normal or has a tumor and the type of tumor if exists,Disease detection is done with different deep learning tasks such as classification, object detection, Image segmentation, etc. In this project we will focus on applying Image classification and segmentation.
# Project Objectives:
1. Apply different Image preprocessing techniques
2. Apply Image Classification to classify each image whether it is a brainscan ora Breastscanand then determining if the image scanis normal or if it has an infection (Tumor)
3. Apply Image segmentation to determine exactly the infected area location
